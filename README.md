The goal of this project was to show the principles of steganography. Steganography is a method malicious actors use to hide data, like malware within files such as images. This project used a combination of Base64 encoding, hashing, and symmetric encryption to mimicking a real-world threat scenario.
The first step involved a file hidden in SecPlus1.jpg. The data was encoded using Base64, a standard encoding algorithm. Once decrypted, this Base64 string revealed the key phrase needed to unlock the file located in SecPlus2.jpg
A separate encrypted file was hidden within SecPlus3.jpg. This is where symmetric encryption came into play, specifically using the AES algorithm. A symmetric key, derived from a SHA-3-256 hash, was used to secure the data. The use of a cryptographic hash ensures the integrity of the key, and the security of the encrypted file. The most challenging part of this project was learning the nuances of AES encryption, particularly how to salt the file. Salting is a critical security measure that adds randomness to the encryption process, protecting against common attacks like brute-force and dictionary attacks.
In the end, this project was a practical lesson in both steganography and cryptography. While getting the VM up and running presented a minor setback, the real challenge and the most rewarding learning experience came from mastering the technical complexities of symmetric encryption. It was a clear demonstration that cryptography is a fascinating and intricate field and understanding its core components is essential for cybersecurity.
